# coins-number

Explanation:
Import Libraries: We import the requests library for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup from bs4 for parsing HTML content.

Define Function: The get_number_of_coins function is defined to fetch and parse the CoinMarketCap homepage.

Set URL and Headers: We set the URL for CoinMarketCap and define headers to mimic a real browser request, which helps avoid being blocked by the website.

HTTP Request: A GET request is sent to the URL, and the response content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.

Find Data: We locate the specific HTML element that contains the number of cryptocurrencies. This part may need adjustments if CoinMarketCap updates their webpage structure. The class sc-1eb5slv-0 hykWbK is used in this example; you may need to inspect the page source for the correct class or ID.

Extract and Convert: The number is extracted from the text, any commas are removed, and it is converted to an integer.

Usage: We call the function and print the number of cryptocurrencies.

Note:
The HTML structure of CoinMarketCap may change over time, so you'll need to inspect the current structure and update the class names or IDs accordingly. This script is designed to work with the structure as of the time of writing.
